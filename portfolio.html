- title: Hyperspectral surgical microscope
  description: When surgeons remove a brain tumor, finding the boundary between diseased and healthy brain tissue may be difficult with the naked eye. In this project we equip a surgical microscope with a hyperspectral camera to precisely map a tumor's shape and give surgeons a window to an otherwise invisible target.

- title: Autonomous surgical robotics
  description: We developed the first autonomous robot for performing surgical anastomoses. By combining a commercially available maniupulator and camera system with custom AI software and end-effector tools, we successfully demonstrated its operation in a pre-clinical validaton study.

- title: Laser speckle contrast imaging
  description: A common question during surgery is determining the perfusion of blood through tissue. We demonstrated how perfusion can be measured by illuminating tissue with an infrared laser, and observing the resulting backscatter from red blood cells.

- title: Depth-from-defocus 3D imaging
  description: Most 3D cameras require two or more viewing angles, which makes them impractical for laparoscopic surgery. We developed a novel single-axis 3D camera based on fast, electronically-tunable liquid lens.

- title: Synethetic rendered ML datasets
  description: With the availability of high quality rendering software, it has recently become possible to generate photorealistic images on commodity computers. We show how these tools can rapidly create ML training datasets that would otherwise be impractical to collect in the field.
